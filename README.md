# Python-Playground
Using LinkedIn Learning to refresh python skills. 
I have been a web developer for over 8 years using Ruby on Rails. However, before learning Ruby, I was a self taught Pythonist and spent time tutoring other women through Women Who Code D.C. 
Since I haven't used Python in years, I just want to refresh skills and build projects.
